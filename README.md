# Hey — I'm Haasi 👋

AI/ML practitioner building friendly, useful systems that actually help people (and occasionally confuse them with clever prompts).

> I make models behave and interfaces play nice together — pragmatic, Python-first, and just the right amount of wit.

## 🔭 About
I'm Haasi, based in Toronto. I design and ship applied NLP and retrieval-augmented systems that connect real data to real users. I care about reproducible pipelines, clean interfaces, and solutions that stop being prototypes and start being useful.

## 🧠 Professional bio
AI/ML practitioner focused on applied NLP, RAG systems, and productionizing model-driven features. I bridge research and product: rapid prototyping that graduates to reliable, well-monitored services.
